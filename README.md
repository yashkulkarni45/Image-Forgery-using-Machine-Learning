Image Classification for Combatting Forged Images

In the digital age, the proliferation of forged and misleading images online can lead to widespread chaos and panic. This application leverages advanced deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to identify and classify images accurately. By training a robust model to distinguish between authentic and manipulated images, we aim to enhance the reliability of online content and mitigate the negative impact of misinformation. This solution represents a crucial step towards maintaining the integrity of visual information in an increasingly digital world.
